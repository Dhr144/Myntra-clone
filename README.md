# Myntra-clone
A Myntra Frontend Clone is a user interface (UI) replica of the popular Indian fashion e-commerce platform, Myntra. This clone focuses on recreating the visual design, layout, and user experience elements of Myntra's frontend, without integrating the backend features like order management, payment processing, or user authentication. It aims to provide a smooth, engaging, and responsive shopping experience, with an emphasis on fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products.
